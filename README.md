# facial_recognition_mysql
Code to use facial recognition to access a MySQL Server

This code makes use of a MySQL Server to store files and users.
They are accessed after the spaces are filled (cpf, username, password) And the information matches that on the server
The path to the image used as database needs to be changed on the Face_Recog.py before using (more than one face can be added)
The same goes for the connector on the MySQL_Connect.py
